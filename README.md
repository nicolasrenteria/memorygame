Submitted by: **NICOLAS RENTERIA**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com/edit/#!/prettysquares?path=README.md%3A26%3A40)

## Required Functionality

The following **button, sounds, and increment Counter** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **pattern randomization, button sounds** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **button glow effect, color gradients** features are implemented:

- [ ] Implemented a Pastel color scheme
- [ ] Upon square click, a glowing effect appears to show the button is activated
- [ ] Linear- gradient command is used to give a a transitional background color

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
A challege i encountered in this project was the syntax. I would forget a bracket, a semi colon etc and the entire code would throw an error.
I had to do a lot of line by line code reviewing to make sure there something I missed. It was struggle coding in javascript for the mere fact that
I could not identify what line need additonal editing. Some of javascript's accepted syntax and commands are slightly
different C++ wich is soemthing I am more familiar with. However, I was able to hone in on my javascript skills and understanding 
of the code by doing some research on the computer language. I learned it in high school but i struggled to jog my memory. A couple of stackoverflow, 
javascript reference and youtube, I was able to dial in on the basic opertaors and function calls in the language. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Can i display a 3D image on a web page?
Is HTML the go to language for web development?
Is the a need for front-end developers depreciating since there are websites builder that generate code based off visual design?
What other projects can I expect to work in the web development industry?



4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours, I would create a sign in page where the user would enter their name in order to enter the game.
I would then add a digital timer in the corner to make the game more diffcult. The timer count would increase depending on which index the user is in 
via square sequence. And lastly, I would add an pop up image for when the console appears in the game. If the user wins, an image 
of a trophy would pop up. If they lose, an image of an empty cookie jar would appear.
